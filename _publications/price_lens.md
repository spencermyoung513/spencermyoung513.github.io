excerpt: 'Price compliance is a vital component of overall execution for brick-and-mortar retailers. Poor price compliance can negatively impact revenue, undermine consumer trust, and invite damaging legal action. Despite the growing deployment of AI-powered solutions for automated compliance monitoring, the task of reliably capturing prices on a display and associating them with products in complex, real-world environments remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on fragile spatial heuristics and rigid shelf-structure assumptions, or otherwise require high-definition, close-up display images that are expensive to obtain. Even state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle with the fine-grained spatial reasoning required for this task. In this work, we present PriceLens, a fully end-to-end system for product-price attribution from retail images. PriceLens integrates off-the-shelf object detection and OCR with a novel transformer-based association model, PriceNet, which learns to associate products and price tags by modeling global spatial and semantic context. Unlike heuristic-based approaches, PriceNet captures compositional relationships directly from data. We show that PriceLens significantly outperforms both heuristic and structural baselines, as well as leading vision-language models, on a challenging real-world shelf dataset. To support further research, we release a new benchmark dataset for product-price association.'
