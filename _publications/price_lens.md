excerpt: 'Product-price attribution, the task of retrieving product pricing information directly from an image of a retail display, is critical for monitoring field execution in brick-and-mortar commerce. Poor price compliance, where displayed and point-of-sale prices diverge, can erode consumer trust, reduce revenue, and invite legal risk. Despite growing interest in AI-powered retail compliance solutions, product-price attribution remains underexplored. Existing methods for this task rely on brittle spatial heuristics, rigid shelf-structure assumptions, or high-resolution, close-up imagery that is expensive to obtain. Even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with the fine-grained spatial reasoning required. To address these challenges, we present PriceLens, an end-to-end system for product-price attribution that combines off-the-shelf object detection and OCR with PriceNet, a novel transformer-based association model. PriceNet learns to match detected products with price tags by modeling global spatial and semantic context, enabling robust parsing of visually complex retail displays. We introduce the first benchmark dataset for this task and show that PriceLens significantly outperforms heuristic, structural, and VLM baselines on challenging real-world display images. To support further research, we release our dataset to the academic community.'
